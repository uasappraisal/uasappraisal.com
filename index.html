        <h3>OUR BEGINNINGS</h3>
        <p>Founded in 1999 by Sam Adams and originally named Universal Appraisal Services changed its name to UAS Appraisal in 2002 based on increasing our service area throughout the entire state of California. 2002 saw the UAS's first assignments outside the state of California when we increased our coverage to include the neighboring states of Nevada and Arizona. UAS Appraisal has been providing our insurance clients almost two decades of the highest quality appraisal services from the finest people in the industry.
           From our small beginnings UAS now locally and regionally employs over 100 professionals to handle operations, call center services, financial services, marketing and sales. The UAS Team makes all the difference and it shows through the high level of customer service and satisfaction enjoyed by our clientele.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6"></i>      
        <h3>NOT JUST AN APPRAISAL COMPANY</h3>
        <p>UAS is relevant in the insurance industry as more than just an outstanding appraisal firm. Our company provides integration assistance and Smartphone/Tablet app technology to our customers and partners in order to better facilitate everyone's end goal of a satisfied vehicle owner. With our technology-forward vantage point, we will always strive to remain as the leader in our field.</p>
        <p>With decades of industry experience, the smartest employees, a top-tier technology department and millions of completed claims our customers know what to expect from UAS - the best independent appraisal product. Since there is no such thing as a "typical" customer, UAS has always been on the front lines of innovation. During the mid-90's when digital photography was in its infancy UAS was there working to provide customers with a higher caliber product using the first Kodak DC cameras. We still put our customer workflow first with the creation of client-specific guidelines and estimate audit rules which are provided for each assignment. Each team within UAS has a laser focus on quick cycle time, accurate estimating and great customer service.</p>

    <h2>Total Loss Value Dispute</h2>
    <div class="row">   
      <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12">
        <div class="service-desc">
          
          <p>If your vehicle is stolen or deemed a non-repairable vehicle and classified as being a total loss (and is not covered by an "Agreed Value/Price" type auto physical damage policy), you will probably be advised to retain an expert & qualified automotive appraiser to negotiate a fair settlement if you disagree with the insurance valuation amount for your car. The insurance claims adjuster or appraiser will offer what they think is the "actual cash value" (ACV) of your car, based on their input of your vehicle's information to their in-house valuation source or their external vendor valuation source (such as ADP, CCC or Mitchell). The insurance valuation is supposed to be an "average" price established from a number of "similar" cars listed for sale.

In virtually all cases where in-house insurance valuation programs, ADP, CCC & Mitchell vendor services are used to value a motor vehicle, all of the found appropriately matching comparable vehicles are not listed or used in the final report. Only certain advertised vehicles are used to produce the completed value report. These specific vehicles may not reflect the actual comparable market vehicles advertised in the retail marketplace, for sale that correlate to the retail fair market value of your own vehicle.

In these cases, the probability is high that UAS Appraisal can help you reach a more realistic retail value settlement for the value of your vehicle. The history of accomplishing this service is extremely well documented throughout the industry!

        <div class="service-desc">
           <p>UAS Appraisal inspects the totaled car at the facility where it is stored (insurance salvage yard or body shop when applicable) to determine the pre-loss condition and value. If the car was stolen and is unrecovered or recovered stripped, he will work from photos, repair invoices, owner descriptions and additional available records. UAS Appraisal has and will also undertake assignments to value a vehicle without a physical inspection of the car.
              This is commonplace within the industry and is performed quite often by many professional automotive appraisers.
              In situations where the loss vehicle is not (or cannot) be inspected, condition, equipment, photographs and other identifying information can be transmitted to UAS Appraisal by the vehicle owner, agent or insurance claims representative. In these type cases, this relayed information can be used to verify the pre-loss condition of the appraised vehicle under a legally sanctioned position.
              UAS Appraisal personally reviews advertisements of comparable cars for sale or verified comparable vehicles sold at various venues. We additionally review auction reports, market price guides, various industry marque newsletters and may call specialty retail dealers or auction company representatives nationwide for realistic value quotes for the loss vehicle with all conditions and equipment noted.
              It is very important to remember, there is no such thing as a universal "book value" for automobiles. A Shelby GT-350 Mustang can be worth considerably more than a 1965 Mustang GT 2+2 (K-Code) "Hi Po". An AC Cobra 289 MK II is worth at least 15% more than an MK I. A "body off" full professional restoration creates a vehicle that is valued considerably more than an "immaculate restored streetcar". A Ferrari, Maserati or Lamborghini with matching numbers is always worth more than a car that does not possess matching numbers for the chassis and power plant.

    <h2>Right To Appraisal</h2>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">     
          <div class="about-text">      
              <p>If an insurance company and its insured do not agree on the amount of the loss, either may demand an appraisal. In this event, each party selects an appraiser to evaluate and declare separately the actual cash value of the loss. If the appraisers fail to agree, they submit their differences to a neutral and disinterested umpire chosen by them. With a long track record of success, we have the judgment and experience to represent you in this proven and cost-effective method to settle disputes.

             <p>We work closely with the insurer and insured, as well as their representatives, to quickly resolve cases to the mutual satisfaction of all involved. Our expert knowledge of vehicles and their market values makes us effective and pragmatic negotiators, able to find common ground under the most contentious circumstances. Through our experience serving as the neutral third party in these proceedings, we thoroughly understand the frame of mind of the umpire.
